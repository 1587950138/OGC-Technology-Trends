|Title      |Description

|Big Data Geo Technologies
|Big Data Geo Technologies is building upon Big Data and referring to the use of predictive analytics, user behaviour analytics, or certain other advanced data analytics methods that extract value from data, and seldom to a particular size of data set.  (DSTL)

|Cloud and HPC
|Cloud computing is defined by US NIST as five essential characteristics of cloud computing: on-demand self-service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity or expansion, and measured service. It also lists three "service models" (software, platform and infrastructure), and four "deployment models" (private, community, public and hybrid) that together categorize ways to deliver cloud services. (NIST)

|Artificial Intelligence
|The central problems (or goals) of AI research include reasoning, knowledge, planning, learning, natural language processing (communication), perception and the ability to move and manipulate objects (Wikipedia)

|Workflow and provenance
|Provenance is information about entities, activities, and people involved in producing a piece of data or thing, which can be used to form assessments about its quality, reliability or trustworthiness. (W3C PROV)

|Big data analytics
|“Big data,” machine learning, and predictive data analytics have been hailed as the fourth paradigm of science, allowing researchers to extract insights from both scientific instruments and computational simulations. (ACM Comm)

|Modeling, Simulation and prediction
|Simulation modeling is the process of creating and analyzing a digital prototype of a physical model to predict its performance in the real world. Models and simulation can be used for analysis and for training
