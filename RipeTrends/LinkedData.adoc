|Title | Linked Data
|Description | "[Linked Data] is a method of publishing structured data so that it can be interlinked and become
more useful through https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_query[semantic queries^]. It builds upon standard
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web[Web^]
technologies such as https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616[HTTP^],
https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-rdf11-concepts-20140225/[RDF^] and https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986[URIs^], but
rather than using them to serve web pages for human readers, it extends them to share information in a way that can
be read automatically by computers." (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data[Wikipedia^])
