|Title |UAVs and Drones
|Description | While large UAVs have been in use for defense, ISR, and remote sensing purposes for many years, the platforms now range in complexity from large, jet-propelled aircraft to palm-sized drones. Similarly, Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs) also have a long history of operations, becoming increasingly sophisticated in recent years with respect to capabilities and autonomy. (OGC WG Charter)
