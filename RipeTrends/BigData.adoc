|Title | Big Geo Data
|Description |Big Data Geo Technologies is building upon Big Data and referring to the use of predictive analytics, user behaviour analytics, or certain other advanced data analytics methods that extract value from data, and seldom to a particular size of data set.
| What is new or emerging?	| Big Data technologies are transforming how geospatial data is processed.  Many of these new technologies were developed outside of geospatial domain enabled by cloud-computing and machine learning.
| Why might it matter? | Themes that emerged from the Location Powers: Big Geo Data workshop, September 2016 were:

-	We live in a download mentality. How do we move to answering questions?  Analytics on the fly

-	Focus shifting from understanding what happened last week to being able to predict what will happen next week

-	Geo big data could take better advantage of developments in Big Data Proper, which is only tangentially interested in Geo Big Data

- Multiple Applications:  Telecommunications, property casualty insurance, financial services, Energy Monitoring and prediction, Population Dynamics, Settlement Mapping

-	Address Big data in OGC Testbeds
