OGC-Technology-Trends
---------------------

Geospatial technology trends as tracked by the Open Geospatial
Consortium (OGC) and the OGC Architecture Board (OAB) are listed on this
and linked pages. A summary of all tracked Trends is provided in the
mindmap. A set of Ripe Trends have been identified as summarized in the
Trend Assessment. Also available is an overview of the
http://www.opengeospatial.org/OGCTechTrends[Technology Trends process].

Each Trend is linked to a GitHub issue - _Comments are welcome and
encouraged on the issue linked to the trend_

A subset of the Tech Trends identified as ``Ripe Trends'' are assessed
as highest and second priority through an analysis summarized in the
graphic below.

Ripe Trends are identified based on characterizations of trend Impact
(Disruptive or Sustaining) and Horizon (Next or After Next). The trends
for highest priority consideration are Trends assessed as Disruptive and
Next.
