|[red]#Event-Driven: Pub-Sub#
|Publishâ€“Subscribe is a messaging pattern where entities can subscribe to a type of message (defined by a criteria) and receive messages that satisfy that criteria from publishers as and when those messages become available (that is, as and when the events that satisfy that criteria occur).

|[red]#Edge Intelligence and Fog Computing#
|Fog computing is a system-level horizontal architecture that distributes resources and services of computing, storage, control and networking anywhere along the continuum from Cloud to Things. (OpenFog Consortium) 

|Agile Geo Processing Chains
|Agile Processing Chains is focusing on Workflow management and linking of geospatial data models. (DSTL)

|On-The-Fly Programming
|On The Fly is a phase and used to describe code that is being changed while the process that the change affects is ongoing. This is aimed a generating products on the fly. (DSTL)
Software interaction patterns	Geospatial Architecture Federation refers to approaches in federation (information technology) including information and geospatial data flows across networks. Also includes incorporating event based architectures and messaging. (DSTL)

|Software Development processes
|Agile software development describes a set of principles for software development under which requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self-organizing cross-functional teams.[1] Based off Agile Architecture, it advocates adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, and continuous improvement, and it encourages rapid and flexible response to change.[2] These principles support the definition and continuing evolution of many software development methods.[3]  (Wikipedia)

|Blockchain and distributed ledger
|Distributed ledger technology based on cryptographic systems that manage, verify and publicly record transaction data; the basis of "cryptocurrencies" such as bitcoin. (World Economic Forum)
