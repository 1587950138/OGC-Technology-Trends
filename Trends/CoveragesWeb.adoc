|Title | Coverages on the Web
|Description | Coverages are geospatial datasets that map spatial-temporal coordinates to a set of data values, e.g., satellite image pixels or geophysical parameters. While the concept of coverages (as per OGC Abstract Topic 6 and the ISO 19123 standards family) encompass regular and irregular grids, point clouds, and general meshes, today emphasis is on (regularly and irregularly) gridded data sets, often called link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_cube[datacubes]. On a larger perspective, the Web is fundamentally organized as a graph structure with node addresses and relation links, and such nodes can be coverages (often of considerable volume). Standards and Best Practices that define Web-native access to Geospatial Coverages are given by the OGC coverage data and service model suite, Coverage Implementation Schema (CIS) and Web Coverage Service (WCS).
