|Title | *Spatial-Temporal Analytics*
|Description |Although real-time spatiotemporal data are now being generated by almost ubiquitously and their applications in research and commerce are widespread and rapidly accelerating, the ability to continuously create and interact in real time with this data is a recent phenomenon.  This real-time spaceâ€“time interactive functionality remains today the underlying process generating the current explosion of fused spatiotemporal data, new geographic research initiatives, and myriad mobile geospatial applications in governments, businesses, and society - (NGAC). |
