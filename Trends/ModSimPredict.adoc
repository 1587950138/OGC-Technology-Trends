|Title | *Modeling, Simulation and Prediction*
|Description | Simulation modelling is the process of creating and analyzing a digital prototype of a physical model to predict its performance in the real world. Models and simulation can be used for analysis and for training.
| What is new or emerging?	|  Convergence of: 1) Gaming and Simulation, 2) Built Environment Modeling and 3) Predictive Earth System Models  
| Why might it matter? | Improved  ability of M&S products and services to be better used by the community, and to further advance the vision of a common, comprehensive model of Earth. In scenarios such as Humanitarian disaster response, being able to process on the fly models, simulations, ensures more timely responses.
Mod/Cim helps with dealing with the transition from data scarcity to data overabundance.  Coordination of predictive model outputs and machine learning.  Mod/SIM can used to support training of predictions/analysis.
