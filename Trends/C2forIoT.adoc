|Title | C2/SCADA for IoT
|Description |Command and control (C2) a well established ability is the exercise of authority over assigned resources in the accomplishment of a common goal. Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) is a information system architecture for high-level process supervisory management of industrial process plants. Applying C2 and SCADA to IoT environments will reuse existing control system technology in a new communications stack of broader reach.
| What is new or emerging?	|
| Why might it matter? | IoT is becoming pervasive. The ability to command and control IoT devices acoording to supervisory goals will bring new emergent behaviors.
