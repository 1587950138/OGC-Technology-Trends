|Meta Trend	| The Power of Location
|Title | Location Authentication
|Description | Confirmation of location is critical for many activities, e.g., location of transactions can determine what taxes apply, the location of the boundary of a property forms the basis of its registration, and the location where evidence is discovered in a crime scene can have an impact on judicial proceedings.  Considering the threats to location information, e.g., spoofing, a greater level of security is emerging for location-referencing.
| What is new or emerging?	|  Technologies such as Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies are being combined with novel ways to establish location trust to form the networks need for location authentication.
| Why might it matter? | Authentication of location is increasing in  relevance for legal and commercial applications.
