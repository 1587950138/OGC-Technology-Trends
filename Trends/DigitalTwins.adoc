|Title | Digital Twin: Static and Dynamic
|Description | A digital twin refers to a virtual model of a process, product or service. Pairing virtual and physical worlds allows analysis of data and monitoring of systems to identify problems before they even occur, prevent downtime, develop new opportunities and even plan for the future by using simulations. [GWF]  A digital twin is a virtual representation of a physical object, which can be used to simulate how the physical object might behave in the physical world under different situations  footnote:[https://www.ice.org.uk/knowledge-and-resources/information-sheet/what-is-a-digital-twin].

| What is new or emerging?	| Digital Twin combines a variety of modern technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), cyber- physical systems (CPS), 3D modeling, simulation, and artificial intelligence (AI), and is at the heart of the fourth industrial revolution. [JETI]
| Why might it matter? | For example, bringing together data for urban planning purposes and making it available to internal stakeholders of different departments within the organization of the city, as well as citizens, through mobile technology [Bentley].

|Tipping Point | Infrastructure and construction industry is ripe for disruption. Being digital ready is no longer an option and those that are not prepared will ultimately be separated from their peers and competition. [SPAR3D]  |
