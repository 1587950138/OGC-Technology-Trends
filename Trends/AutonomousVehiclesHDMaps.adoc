|Title | *Autonomous Vehicle HD Maps*
|Description | Maps created at centimetre or sub-centimetre precision, typically to support driverless-cars and other autonomous ground vehicles that operate in built-up areas [1] footnote:].
| What is new or emerging?	|  Although mapping organizations are likely to embrace standards to allow them to incorporate data from many sources, a fully open ecosystem seems unlikely. The companies involved will prefer to maintain semi-closed ecosystems [2]
| Why might it matter? | To achieve the CAV ambition, geospatial data is key. Not just to the creation of a realistic simulation environment to test in, but also to the eventual deployment of a new infrastructure to enable improved connectivity and mobility.[3]
