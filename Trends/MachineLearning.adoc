|Title | *Machine Learning and CNNs on Imagery*
|Description | Machine learning is the subfield of computer science that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.  Deep learning and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) - a sub type of machine learning -  consists of multiple hidden layers in an artificial neural network - (Wikipedia).
| What is new or emerging?	| Deep Learning is advancing rapidly based on increasing computing capabilities, image databases and trained CNNs.
| Why might it matter? | The ability to detect features using CNNs

|Horizon   |  *Next*:  Multiple CNNs have been applied to remote sensed data with impressive results.  Questions remain about provenance and uncertainty.  There is a need for trained models.  Transferability of trained models and interoperability of CNNs are open questions.
