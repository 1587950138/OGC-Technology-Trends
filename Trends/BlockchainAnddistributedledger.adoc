|Title | Blockchain and distributed ledger
|Description | Distributed ledger technology based on cryptographic systems that manage, verify and publicly record transaction data; the basis of "cryptocurrencies" such as bitcoin - (World Economic Forum).
| What is new or emerging?	| Over recent years, there has been a steady increase in the level of industry interest in distributed ledgers. Propelled by the apparent success of cryptographic currencies such as Bitcoin.
| Why might it matter? | Distributed ledger technologies such as Blockchain are now being explored in application areas such as land registration [1], law enforcement trust models for sharing digital evidence (e.g. collected from body-worn cameras) [2], the next generation of space technologies [3] and several others.
|Horizon   |  *Next*:  Developments are underway in OGC Standards Program.
