|Title | *MicroGeography*
|Description |Personal electronic devices now measure much of our activity and context.  New methods to capture, quantify and communicate individual human activity at a micro level are now available, e.g., OASIS's Classification of Everyday Living (COEL). Rating services for individual behaviors, e.g., risk rating, will develop similar to credit risk rating services.
| What is new or emerging?	| Standards for MicroGeography.  Rating services based on MicroGeography
| Why might it matter? | Increased understanding of human behavior at a individual human scale.  Unclear affect of rating services on individual and collective behavior.
|Horizon   |  *AfterNext*:  Standards are nearing final (COEL) while the industry behind using the data are nacent with policy and privacy (or information self-determination) policies and laws needed to be clarified.
