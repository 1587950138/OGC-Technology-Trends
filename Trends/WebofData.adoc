|Meta Trend	|link:https://github.com/opengeospatial/OGC-Technology-Trends/blob/master/chapter-05.adoc[Spatial Data on the Web]
|Title | *Web of Data*
|Description |  Data published on the web are made discoverable, accessible and interoperable using WWW best practices for data formats, data access, data identifiers, metadata, licensing and provenance.
| What is new or emerging?	| •W3C Workshop on Web Standardization for Graph Data – March 2019
    - Support for adding geospatial and temporal to graph query languages
•Emerging progress on Property Graphs standards in JTC 1 SQL  - June 2019
    - Property Graph Queries as a new part of SQL standards, 9075-16.
    - New declarative property graph language  - may be called GQL.
•Schema.org and JSON-LD
| Why might it matter? | •OGC Environmental Linked Features Interoperability Experiment
Power of OGC APIs to expose features in the context of rich domain-feature-model-based linked data while following W3C best practices
•Advantages similar to adding Topology to Geometry queries.
