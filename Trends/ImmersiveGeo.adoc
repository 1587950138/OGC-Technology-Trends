|Title | Immersive Geo: AR, VR, Mixed Reality
|Description | Virtual reality (VR) refers to computer technologies that use software to generate realistic images, sounds and other sensations that replicate a real environment. Augmented reality (AR) is a live direct or indirect view of a physical, real-world environment whose elements are augmented by computer-generated sensory input such as sound, video, graphics or GPS data.
| What is new or emerging?	| After an initial flourish of AR Applications by Layar, Metaio and Wikitude - including interoperability based on open standards [1, 2] - the AR market cooled until recent product announcements by large vendors:  Pokemon Go in Summer 2016; Apple demoed new take on AR at WWDC 2017; Microsoft Hololens.
| Why might it matter? | Increased understanding of the world around us, such as accurate location of utilities networks.
|Horizon   |  *AfterNext*: Eyewear that is acceptable to mass market remains elusive.  Commercial applications, e.g., construction and maintenance industries, may lead deployments.
