|Title | Dynamic datums
|Description | This is now starting to be referred to as an “Earth-fixed” datum but previously was often referred to as a “dynamic datum”.  Conceptually, the term “dynamic datum” confuses many people, who assume it to mean that the datum itself is constantly changing.  This is obviously not the case – the datum is uniquely defined and fixed in orientation and location.  Rather, an “Earth-fixed” datum allows the changes in coordinates of points on the Earth’s “dynamic” surface to be referenced and represented. (ANZLIC).  The revision of ISO 19111 anticipates the need for Dynamic Datums.

|Horizon   |  *After Next*:  Standards have been developed (ISO 19111) but the need and the implementations are not yet available.
