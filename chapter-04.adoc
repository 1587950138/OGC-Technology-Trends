|Title      |Description

|Data Science Analytics
|Data Science Analytics refers to a number of data science advances including  Machine Learning (gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed), Anomaly detection (he identification of items, events or observations which do not conform to an expected pattern or other items in a dataset.) (DSTL)

|Image Processing
|Digital image processing refers to the use of computer algorithms to perform image processing on digital images. Advances in data science are changing on the way digital image processing is occurring. (DSTL)

|Uncertainty, Veracity
|Uncertainty is a situation which involves imperfect and/or unknown information, including aspects of cognition (the process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought, experience and senses) and plays a part in understanding Uncertainty Information. How this information is assessed for data quality is important. (DSTL)

|Machine Learning
|Machine learning is the subfield of computer science that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.  Deep learning - a sub type of machine learning -  consists of multiple hidden layers in an artificial neural network. (Wikipedia)

|Spatial-Temporal Analytics
|Although real-time spatiotemporal data are now being generated by almost ubiquitously and their applications in research and commerce are widespread and rapidly accelerating, the ability to continuously create and interact in real time with this data is a recent phenomenon.  This real-time space–time interactive functionality remains today the underlying process generating the current explosion of fused spatiotemporal data, new geographic research initiatives, and myriad mobile geospatial applications in governments, businesses, and society. (NGAC)

|Conflation
|Conflation refers to the act of combining two distinct maps into one new map. It is similar to the practice of image mosaicking. It is usually carried out by registration of an overlapping area. Conflation for digital maps refers to the process of associating real world coordinates to digital ones and it is named Map Matching. (DSTL)
