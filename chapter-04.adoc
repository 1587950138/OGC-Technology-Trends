|link:OtherTrends/TextAnalytics.adoc[Text Analytics]
|Text Analytics refers to the process of deriving high-quality information from text. Applications of this are Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Social Media harvesting. An example is to scan a set of documents written in a natural language and either model the document set for predictive classification purposes or populate a database or search index with the information extracted - (DSTL).

|link:RipeTrends/UncertVeracity.adoc[Uncertainty, Veracity]
|Uncertainty is a situation which involves imperfect and/or unknown information, including aspects of cognition (the process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought, experience and senses) and plays a part in understanding Uncertainty Information. How this information is assessed for data quality is important - (DSTL).

|The central problems (or goals) of AI research include reasoning, knowledge, planning, learning, natural language processing (communication), perception and the ability to move and manipulate objects (Wikipedia).

|Although real-time spatiotemporal data are now being generated by almost ubiquitously and their applications in research and commerce are widespread and rapidly accelerating, the ability to continuously create and interact in real time with this data is a recent phenomenon.  This real-time space–time interactive functionality remains today the underlying process generating the current explosion of fused spatiotemporal data, new geographic research initiatives, and myriad mobile geospatial applications in governments, businesses, and society - (NGAC).

|Conflation refers to the act of combining two distinct maps into one new map. It is similar to the practice of image mosaicking. It is usually carried out by registration of an overlapping area. Conflation for digital maps refers to the process of associating real world coordinates to digital ones and it is named Map Matching - (DSTL).

|Command and control (C2) a well established ability is the exercise of authority over assigned resources in the accomplishment of a common goal. Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) is a information system architecture for high-level process supervisory management of industrial process plants. Applying C2 and SCADA to IoT environments will reuse existing control system technology in a new communications stack of broader reach.
