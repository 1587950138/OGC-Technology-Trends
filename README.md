# OGC-Technology-Trends
Geospatial technology trends as tracked by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and the OGC Architecture Board (OAB) are listed on this and linked pages. A summary of all tracked Trends is provided in the mindmap.  A set of Ripe Trends have been identified as summarized in the Trend Assessment.  Also avaiable is an overview of the [Technology Trends process](http://www.opengeospatial.org/OGCTechTrends).

Each Trend is linked to a GitHub issue - *Comments are welcome and encouraged on the issue linked to the trend*

## Trends grouped into meta-trends:

   * [The Power of Location](chapter-01.adoc)
   * [Spatial and Temporal Models](chapter-02.adoc)
   * [Data Science Analytics](chapter-04.adoc)
   * [Big Data](chapter-03.adoc)
   * [Spatial Data on the Web](chapter-05.adoc)
   * [New Geo Sources](chapter-06.adoc)
   * [Human Computer Interaction](chapter-07.adoc)
   * [Software Development and Patterns](chapter-08.adoc)

## Ripe Trends

A subset of the Tech Trends identified as "Ripe Trends" are assessed as highest and second priority through an analysis summarized in the graphic below.

Highest Priority
* [Autonomous Vehicle HD Maps](Trends/AutonomousVehiclesHDMaps.adoc)
* [Blockchain/Distributed Ledger](Trends/BlockchainAnddistributedledger.adoc)
* [GEO at Platform Scale](Trends/GEOAtPlatformScale.adoc)
* [Machine Learning/CNNs](Trends/MachineLearning.adoc)
* [Modeling, Simulation and Prediction](Trends/ModSimPredict.adoc)
* [UAVs and Drones](Trends/UXS.adoc)
* [Web of Data](Trends/WebofData.adoc)

Second Priority
* [3D model creation](Trends/3DModels.adoc)
* [5G Cellular Communications](Trends/5G.adoc)
* [Edge and Fog Computing](Trends/EdgeIntelligenceAndFogComputing.adoc)
* [Immersive Geo: AR, VR, Mixed Reality](Trends/ImmersiveGeo.adoc)
* [Indoor: Position, Models and Navigation](Trends/Indoor.adoc)
* [Quantum Computing](Trends/QuantumComputing.adoc)
* [Workflow/Provenance](Trends/WorkflowAndProvenance.adoc)

Ripe Trends are identified based on characterizations of trend Impact (Disruptive or Sustaining) and Horizon (Next or After Next).  The trends for highest priority consideration are Trends assessed as Disruptive and Next.
